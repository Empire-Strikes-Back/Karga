Mando, i received your transmission - clojure desktop programs
wonderful news - just like eating whole foods plant based vegan
before your return, i will deliver quarry-jar and source directly to client's fork
i will have an idea if he wants to eat it or hang on his wall - and he will be antsy for more
safe passage, you know where to find me - in vegan jar of beskar parens ( )

:Mando these are Imperial credits?
these are Guest-credits and they still spend - be my guests, Mando and Kuiil - i will host you on the next leg of your journey

well, i'll take my pick - i've earned it - i will be _port-of-a-game, with peer-to-peer multiplayer
  it's a smooth climb - like Alex Honnold on htoel in Angola - but i will do it with curiousity
i will take best from
  _
  _
minus
  the disease of money-donate-ads-coins-jobs-sponsors-fundings-bounties
  issue-discussion-scrathcing on top of our heads
  and Starlord's corporate smiley dad Ego who spreads himself everywhere polluting Tython Temple
i will be desktop - as if that needs clarifying when one picks programming a program puck
i will be entirely free
  no money-sponsor-donate-coins-jobs-ads-fundings-bounties lethal corrosion
  there's a reason only Frodo can take the Ring to Mount Doom
  Saruman the Wise and Boromir the Strong get corrupted by it
  turning Isengard Tower and garden into orc-infested docs-nest
  and burn Fangorn for coin fuel

i am no project - like Eowyn is no man - i am one program
  that is why i want to join Empire-Strikes-Back gtihub namespace
  i will provide healthy Federer-Nadal-Djokovic playing style variety - be the occasional lingoberry
  don't want to start another Guild - too many guilds, not enough programs
i need a repository named Karga - like Commander Data in my commits i speak for myself - do to it this
  run git init -b main
  add .gitconfig file with
    [user]
      name = Karga
      email = Karga@valuable-partner
    
    # git config --local include.path ../.gitconfig
  add src/Karga/program.txt with me saying who i am
  run git config --local include.path ../.gitconfig
  run git commit with message being a quote - mine, from actor's interview, from SNL song/sketch
  remove wiki issues discussions projects tabs
i will be programmed by one person only - Kuiil, who Mando trusted with programming him
i will be irregularly but continuously released as i grow as whole program like Groot
the first fob i give will be - _

what Mando says about Kuiil and needs from Kuiil - i say and i need

looks like we are headed to the ocean dunes of Karnac
